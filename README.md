# AssemblyInterpreter
A program made to interpret assembly-level instructions, and execute them by emulating assembly patterns.
The program can load a .txt file with assembly instructions via Load Assembly button on the UI.
Use the keys:
    Tab:    Execute a single instruction.
    Space:  Toggle autoplay of program.
    Esc:    Exit program.

Folder "AssemblyCode" has three exemples of assembly instructions with the correct format, made in order to
test the integrity of the project. Make sure to never surpass 150 positions of memory: That can break the memory
limit.

Made using Unity 2019.2.4f1 for Windows platforms.
